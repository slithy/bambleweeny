# The permission system of the bot is based on a "just works" basis
# You have permissions and the bot has permissions. If you meet the permissions
# required to execute the command (and the bot does as well) then it goes through
# and you can execute the command.
# If these checks fail, then there are two fallbacks.
# A role with the name of Bot Mod and a role with the name of Bot Admin.
# Having these roles provides you access to certain commands without actually having
# the permissions required for them.
# Of course, the owner will always be able to execute commands.
