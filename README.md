The Bambleweeny 57 Submeson Brain, a dice-rolling bot with support for Castles &amp; Crusades.

This project is a fork of [Avrae](https://github.com/avrae/avrae). Basically I kept the dice-rolling
part, deleted all the 5e-specific stuff and wrote some new commands to support
[Castles &amp; Crusades](http://www.trolllord.com/indexnew.html).
